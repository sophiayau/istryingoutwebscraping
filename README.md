# My first run with web scraping!
Join me on my journey to teach myself web scraping ðŸ˜„

### Motivation
During my time as a Data Science Fellow with CUNY Tech Prep, I discovered a deep appreciation for working with data. Data is everywhere, and it interests me greatly because it holds endless possibilities for insights and innovation.  

I had an idea for a project that I was excited about, but to bring it to life, I realized I needed to learn data scraping. And... thatâ€™s what led me here! 

### Resources
I've compiled a list of resources that I used to help me learn web scraping if you're someone who's also interested in picking up this skill.
